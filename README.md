# CV-Shortlisting-System
Developed a CV Shortlisting System using Python and the system was built using Flask to provide a user-friendly interface, while PyPDF2 was utilized for extracting text from PDF resumes, and NLTK was employed for text processing. The system efficiently parses and analyzes resumes to shortlist candidates based on predefined criteria.

This project was performed in VS Code but feel free to use whichever application you might prefer
